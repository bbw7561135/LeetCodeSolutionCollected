#### Q1:Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
#### You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#### Example:
#### Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
#### Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
#### return [0, 1].

#### There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
#### Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
#### You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
<br>
#### Example 1:
#### nums1 = [1, 3]
#### nums2 = [2]
#### The median is 2.0
<br>
#### Example 2:
#### nums1 = [1, 2]
#### nums2 = [3, 4]
#### The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
